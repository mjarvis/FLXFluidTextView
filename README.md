#FLXFluidTextView

FLXFluidTextView is a UITextView subclass that automatically adjusts its frame based on its content size.

The properties `maximumHeight` and `minimumHeight` can be set to place limits on the text view's fluidity. Additionally, `maximumNumberOfLines` and `minimumNumberOfLines` can be set to automatically set the `maximumHeight` and `minimumHeight` properties, respectively, based upon the line height of the text view's font.
